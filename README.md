# ML Assignment 2 – Classification Models

## Problem Statement
The objective of this assignment is to implement and evaluate multiple machine learning
classification models on a real-world dataset. The models are compared using standard
evaluation metrics and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this assignment is the **Credit Card Default Dataset**, which contains
information about credit card clients and whether they defaulted on their payment.

- **Type of problem**: Binary classification  
- **Target variable**: Default payment (Yes / No)  
- **Number of instances**: ~30,000  
- **Number of features**: 23 (including demographic and financial attributes)  
- **Source**: Public dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  

This dataset was chosen because it satisfies the minimum feature and instance requirements
and is suitable for evaluating both linear and ensemble classification models.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifier  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
4. Naive Bayes Classifier  
5. Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble)  
6. XGBoost Classifier (Ensemble)

Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

(Comparison table and observations will be added after model implementation.)
